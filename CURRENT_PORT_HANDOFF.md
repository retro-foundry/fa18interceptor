# C port handoff

Updated 2026-10-01. This is the current work state. Older notes remain in git
history (the preceding handoff is in commit ebbfc3da); ignored gate logs may
also remain under build/recomp/.
PORT.md describes the architecture and source conventions.

## Objective and order

Recreate readable C for the whole game, proven against the original source and
sealed native recordings. Work in related batches. The order is Stage D game C,
Stage F native backend, then only the Stage E Kickstart services still needed.
The user explicitly deferred OS work and asked for larger routine batches.

## Verified baseline

- 419 of 624 translated game entries are registered in port/game/glue/ports.c.
  The latest full gate for that registered set matched 703,341 completed shadow
  calls and 1,129,309 sandbox calls across three native recordings, with zero
  mismatches and identical poison frames. Ported parents absorb some formerly
  counted child calls, so the aggregate call totals need not rise monotonically.
  build/recomp/ports_report_*.json describe this 419-entry baseline. GNU and
  MSVC builds pass. In addition to active planes and the earlier audio batch,
  24 registered glyph, input, page, notification, command/audio, buffer,
  polygon, face, postflight and followup entries now use source-timed steps.
  These isolated bridges match fresh source OFF output on all 36,236 frames. The
  combined instruction oracle matches 2,238 instructions and 71,616 cases. See
  analysis/routines/native_c_registered_timing_batch.md.
  The new four-entry map/region batch is independently exact across all
  36,236 live frames. Its 735 instructions also match 23,520 fixtures with
  DMA bus contention enabled. See analysis/routines/native_c_map_region_activation.md.
  C279D0 is also newly registered: its independent live output matches all
  36,236 frames, and its 271 instructions pass 8,672 DMA-contention fixtures.
  Readable whole-call C separately matches 3,258 shadow and 1,967 sandbox calls,
  plus 4,096 structural cases including partial writes and edge clamps. See
  analysis/routines/native_c_grid_projection_activation.md.
- The current recordings are captures/native/demo01,
  captures/native/qual_carrier_success, and
  captures/native/qual_fail_crashes. Each has state.bin, input.fa18in, and
  run.json with a sealed final RAM hash. Archived captures/uae runs, including
  run075, are historical evidence and are not an acceptance gate.
- The headless GNU and MSVC Release builds pass. The typed port's eight
  affected map/detail contract tests passed with the map source changes.
- Only .vscode/ is untracked; it belongs to the user. Leave it alone.
- C2AA9C, C2AB34, C2AB5A and C2B05A are now registered with resumable source
  timing. The map parent reuses port/map_packet_depth_stage.c; its normal/wide
  children reuse the established map packet core. Their readable whole-call
  glue is checked separately from the instruction steps by
  python tools/recomp/check_map_region_glue.py. This isolated registry variant
  matched 281 shadow and 3,988 sandbox calls without changing the normal runner.
- The region probe additionally matches original registers and RAM on 4,096
  direct structural oracle cases, including signed coordinates, sloped edges,
  endpoint exclusions and randomized high register halves. The oracle found
  and corrected the old C's near-endpoint exit: $C2B1E4/$C2B1FE abandon the
  directory walk, not just one segment. See
  analysis/routines/c2b05a_record_region_probe.md.
- The registered all-native path is not yet frame-faithful. Complete
  source-timed bridges now give exact isolated output for the
  C31226/C3129A/C31312 postflight group and C305AA polygon edge across all three
  sealed recordings. C0FA04 is also source-timed and exact across the three
  recordings. A fresh 500-frame all-registered demo replay now first differs at
  one-based frame 416 by 361 pixels. Fixed-charge ranking finds several
  independent early differences after C2005C became source-timed and exact:
  C212B0, C332BC, C23CA6 and C246A0 at frame 416; C3201A at frame 424; and
  C26EBE at frame 441.
  C0D752 also differs at frame 416 with its original 50,000-cycle charge, while
  C0D74A first differs at frame 484. C2DEE0, C2DB18 and C2D99C are exact
  through 500 in isolation.
  Shadow/sandbox matches do not establish live ON fidelity for the whole
  registered set.
- Plane shadow now replays the live source's ordered DMACONR inputs on saved
  entry RAM. It independently checks native outputs and write sequences, and
  fails extra/reordered/missing reads. All five former counter failures now
  compare and pass. Report fields busy_input_calls/reads expose this proof
  input model. Two intentionally incorrect bridge copies are rejected by
  tools/recomp/check_shadow_busy_inputs.py. Full ON replay separately proves
  the actual timing. No mismatch or hardware classification was suppressed.

## Newly activated grid projection packet

C279D0 now implements the complete three-table packet in
port/game/grid_projection_packet.c, with CPU effects and resumable timing in
separate glue files. It preserves source-selected depth gates, sparse-matrix
projection, negative record kinds, partial triangle writes, coordinate clamps,
and both pixel helpers. All 36,236 isolated live frames are exact.

The structural oracle found a word-overflow distinction at C27BD6/C27C98:
BLE after ADD.W tests the signed unwrapped sum, whereas subsequent CMP.W
instructions compare wrapped depth. That case is retained in 4,096 original-
instruction fixtures, including 12 partial-write and 13 edge-clamp cases.
Custom writes are held in these structural fixtures; the separate live replay
proves actual drawing and event timing.

The generic tools/recomp/check_whole_call_glue.py ENTRY... now supplies
independent readable-C checks for future batches. It reuses cached objects and
an isolated registry, running the three recordings concurrently. The earlier
check_map_region_glue.py delegates to it with its four default entries.

## Previous map and region batch

The previous map/region live blockers are resolved. C2AB34/C2AB5A share the
source-timed packet bridge, C2AA9C supplies the depth-stage frame and pass
sequence, and C2B05A retains the source's interrupt boundaries and unusual
D2/D4-D6 restore. Domain observers remain mathematical values; CPU effects
stay in glue. No new gameplay or placeholder behavior was introduced.

The first map bridge passed CPU-only instruction fixtures yet accumulated
bus delays from extra reads on CLR memory instructions. A boundary trace found
the first difference at C2AD22 in frame 297. Removing those reads made the
600-frame map trace identical and the complete isolated live batch exact.
The instruction oracle's new --bus option checks memory-access timing under
DMA contention so this distinction is covered before expensive full replays.

## New timing evidence

- Optional FA18_BOUNDARY_TRACE=PATH and FA18_BOUNDARY_RANGE=LO-HI (hex,
  exclusive HI) produce instruction/flow-target and chipset-service CSV rows,
  with CPU registers, SR, cycles, next event, frame/line and blit/interrupt
  state. tools/recomp/summarize_boundary_trace.py reports costs and event sites.
- On the complete sealed demo, 17 original region calls cost 20,214-47,376
  live cycles including waits and interrupts. Fourteen enter $FC0D14 and
  span the next frame. The first starts in frame 19,443 and interrupts at
  $C2B19E after 2,560 cycles. The traced replay matched sealed final RAM.
- First-600-frame traces include 22 wide-map calls, 5 normal-map calls and
  22 active-plane calls. Wide-map calls starting at frames 299, 327, 349,
  366 and 384 each include 416 blits before returning.
- Commands, artifact hashes, source interrupt sites and interpretation limits
  are in analysis/routines/native_c_call_boundary_timing.md. Filtered rows
  omit chipset events inside children and interrupt handlers outside the
  selected address range; start/end frames still prove those crossings.

## Next work

1. Prioritize additional unregistered game functions in related batches.
   The user explicitly asked for progress in the function count; avoid another
   standalone audit of already registered fixed-charge routines as the main
   batch. C279D0 is complete and activated. Start with C1D10C (648 instructions;
   terrain_* groundwork), including its placement emission and cache tail.
   Inspect indirect-call parents C0F5F8 and the C1CB14/C1CB26 siblings for explicit child contracts;
   the candidate tool excludes them. Preserve the original-source authority.
   Group shared bodies and children, prove readable whole-call C independently
   of timing steps, then run the full gate and isolated live checks.
   Reuse FA18Port's resumable step and source range for calls that cross
   chipset events, children or frames; helpers live in glue_step.h. Use
   --bus instruction fixtures with varied horizontal phases before full
   replay. Keep unported children explicit rather than counting partial
   functions or graph tails. The three C0004E/C000B4/C000BA candidates are
   Kickstart trampolines and remain deferred.
2. Continue the registered timing audit with the frame-416 renderer group:
   C212B0, C332BC, C23CA6 and C246A0. C2005C is now source-timed and exact in
   isolation, while the complete registered set remains at frame 416. Group
   entries where they share child boundaries. C0D74A and
   C0D752 share the long C0D758-C0DA9E body and should eventually use one timing
   bridge. Their measured mean source charges make each isolated entry exact
   through frame 500, but that diagnostic was not retained because a fixed mean
   does not prove path-dependent or event-boundary timing. Use
   `python scripts/probe_recomp_timing.py ENTRY... --frames 500` to rank entries;
   it creates one source stream, overwrites one candidate stream per probe and
   removes both on exit. Test entries individually because timing interactions
   make recursive subset bisection non-monotonic. Keep
   porting independent game-source groups while timing work proceeds.
3. Once game source is complete, build the native backend from plain C memory,
   drawing, and audio. Reassess which Kickstart services remain; do OS work
   last as requested.

## Gate for a registered batch

- Read original instructions with python tools/recomp/port_info.py ADDRESS,
  then the corresponding analysis/routines report and typed port code. Preserve
  exact word arithmetic, high register halves, MOVEM.W sign extension, memory
  writes, and child effects. Reuse narrow register-effect helpers; never run a
  child with side effects twice.
- Build headless on this Windows workspace with
  & 'C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe' scripts/build_recomp.sh
  and build MSVC with
  cmake --build build/recomp-cmake --config Release -j 8
- Probe the new batch, then run
  & 'C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe' scripts/recomp_ports_check.sh
  over all three native recordings. It checks shadow, sandbox, sealed final
  RAM, and poison frames. Inspect per-entry calls, incomplete calls, and every
  mismatch. QUICK=1 is only a first-recording probe.
- Compare live `--ports on` RGB444 output with fresh `--ports off` source
  output for every affected recording, not just final RAM, frame count or blit
  totals. Set `PORTS_ONLY` to the comma-separated registered batch and run
  `& 'C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe' scripts/recomp_live_check.sh`.
  The recordings run concurrently and temporary streams are removed. An
  inactive entry needs temporary registration for a probe and must be removed
  if live output differs. A stepped SHADOW stream is not the live source
  oracle because source-first hardware-input replay can alter its timing.
- Increase the registered count and update this file only after every gate
  passes. Commit a coherent source batch with its evidence.
- Rank registered fixed-charge timing debt with
  `python scripts/probe_recomp_timing.py ENTRY... --frames 500`. Each positional
  argument is one entry, a comma-separated group, or `ALL`. The bounded probe
  reuses a single source stream and removes its scratch streams by default.
  `--rank-fixed N --differences-only` selects the N largest accumulated drifts
  from the latest demo gate report before probing them.
- Independently prove readable whole-call C with
  `python tools/recomp/check_whole_call_glue.py ENTRY...`; registered timing
  steps are disabled only in the temporary proof registry.
- The headless Ninja graph tracks source and header dependencies and shares
  objects with structural oracles and mutation builds. An unchanged build is
  subsecond. Do not manually touch generated C after a header change.
