# Current playable port handoff

Updated 2026-10-05 following the user's source-ownership correction and request
to remove the abandoned top-level port. This file supersedes earlier resume
instructions; previous handoffs and removed source are preserved in git history.

## Work scope

Work on `port/game/`, `port/game/glue/` and the actual `port/recomp/` runtime.
The goal is the playable game without Kickstart or emulation. Do not build a
parallel gameplay implementation in the top-level `port/` directory.
A component proof counts as runtime progress only when the active runner uses it.

The abandoned `fa18_port` source/build and disconnected native replacement
components were removed. The 48 retained shared source/header files have now
been moved into `port/game/`: disk/Hunk loaders, map-packet code, its projection
type header and three command type headers. No top-level `port/*.c` or
`port/*.h` files remain. Build paths and active includes use the new locations.
The CMake runtime now compiles the map core with the other game sources; the
Amiga loader library compiles disk/Hunk once. The GNU source glob includes all
of these without duplicate explicit source lists. See `port/README.md`.

Historical `analysis/routines/native_*.md` notes without the `native_c_` prefix
and standalone `tools/recomp/check_native_*` component tools may reference the
removed implementation. They are historical evidence, not a resume plan or
runnable acceptance gates for the active game. Inspect their source dependencies
before using them. The disconnected uncommitted shared-origin batch was dropped.

Removal validation: both active runners build with MSVC Release and GNU;
all eleven active CTests pass. The GNU and MSVC ADF-only launcher checks pass
185 Hunk/8,441 relocation construction, both CPU modes, splash, credits and
keyboard-to-demo, with zero ROM accesses or unsupported services. Hash checks
before relocation confirmed all 697 tracked active-tree files, all 48 retained
sources and the three user-owned guard/allowlist files were unchanged.

Relocation validation also passes both MSVC/GNU runner builds, all eleven active
CTests and both ADF-only launcher checks. All 48 moved implementations are
unchanged apart from four loader include paths; the GNU manifest has 450 unique
existing source files. Loader/OFS checks match all 185 hunks, 8,441 relocations
and 22 resource hashes. The retained RGB4 and viewport comparison tools now use
the moved loaders and exclude checkpoint dependencies on deleted components:
16,384 RGB4 and 32,768 viewport construction/merge calls match their frozen host
implementations. These shared host components are used by the active runner.

## Active runner state

`fa18_romfree` loads the original game/resources from an ADF without Kickstart
or a savestate, using reusable host compatibility/loading in `port/amiga/`,
Interceptor configuration in `port/romfree/`, and guest adapters in `port/os/`.
It still uses Musashi, guest RAM and the chipset model. Removing the abandoned
sources does not establish emulation independence.

The last active function milestone (`05fa7453`) statically recompiles 85 deferred
entries in `port/recomp/generated/recomp_static_deferred.c`. They retain explicit
`STATIC_RECOMP`/`TODO(decompile)` markers and per-entry debt in
`recomp_deferred.json`. The inventory includes 539 readable translated entries
and 75 additional readable source-only callable entries. Static compilation
still depends on shared CPU/machine state and is not readable decompilation.
See `analysis/routines/static_recomp_deferred.md` and its checkpoint for the
existing validation scope and original call-graph limitations.

Existing ROM-free verification covers clean startup/demo, menu and active
mission entry/restart, and original configuration save/load. Full mission
outcomes/progression, carrier success and active-flight teardown remain open.
See `analysis/routines/romfree_machine_startup.md`,
`analysis/routines/romfree_exact_followup.md` and
`analysis/routines/romfree_performance_followup.md` for evidence and limits.

## Next work and validation

Trace the real startup/frame graph through `port/game/` and the active runtime;
remove CPU/guest-bus/chipset dependencies there in connected, source-backed
changes. Reuse the retained shared code where it is actually called. Do not
resume the removed standalone bootstrap/pose/control-owner plan.

Build the MSVC runners with `cmake -S port/recomp -B build/recomp-cmake` and
`cmake --build build/recomp-cmake --config Release`. Headless GNU builds use
`python scripts/build_recomp.py` and `python scripts/build_recomp.py --romfree`.
Run `ctest --test-dir build/recomp-cmake -C Release --output-on-failure`.
For changed gameplay use `scripts/recomp_ports_check.sh` and affected live
RGB/RAM comparisons with `scripts/recomp_live_check.sh`, plus targeted original
routine proofs. Keep known combined readable-C timing debt explicit.

Original disk bytes and source behavior remain the authority; emulator/ROM
runs and sealed captures are validation evidence. Do not alter
`scripts/check_native_build.py`, `scripts/native_frame_count.py` or
`port/native_data_allowlist.txt`. The former `fa18_port` guard is retained as
user-owned historical tooling; its removed target is not an active build.
Preserve unrelated `.vscode/` content. Commit completed validated batches as
previously requested. The emulation-independence goal remains unfinished.
